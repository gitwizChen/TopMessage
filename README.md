A beautiful way of message prompting instead of Toastüòàüòàüòç!

![sample](screenshots/sample.gif)

# Principle
Just set a view to the current activity decor view. May be the effect is different before Android L!

From version 1.0.3, you don't have to set the current activity to manager but the **TopActivityManager** will do this, that's why first step of Usage is so important.
More information please read [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11411395/how-to-get-current-foreground-activity-context-in-android/29786451#29786451).

# Install

```groovy
// Gradle
compile 'com.wizchen.topmessage:topmessage:1.0.5'
```

```xml
// Maven
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.wizchen.topmessage</groupId>
  <artifactId>topmessage</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.5</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

```xml
// Ivy
<dependency org='com.wizchen.topmessage' name='topmessage' rev='1.0.5'>
  <artifact name='topmessage' ext='pom' />
</dependency>
```

# Usage

1.Add the code below in your custom application

```Java
public class App extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(TopActivityManager.getInstance());
    }
}
```

2.Just enjoy yourself!

```Java
// the simplest and the default effect
TopMessageManager.showSuccess(msg);
```

```Java
// use custom duration
TopMessageManager.showSuccess(msg, duration);
```

```Java
// use custom duration and title
TopMessageManager.showSuccess(msg, duration, title);
```

```Java
// with a common button
TopMessageManager.showSuccess(msg, title, commonCallback, commonButtonText);
```

```Java
// with a confitm button and a cancel button
TopMessageManager.showSuccess(msg, title, confirmOrCancelCallback, confirmButtonText, cancelButtonText);
```

```Java
// with a input area
TopMessageManager.showSuccess(msg, title, sendCallback, sendButtonText, inputHint);
```

Happy to hear any good suggestions! Just stars!

# Todo

- More style and icon
- Show from bottom like SnackBar?
- Block current thread so that user can go on after the message view is dismissed?
